> <p><b>:bell: Heads Up: </b> I worked on this project in my initial days just to learn React, JavaScript, and extension development. It's time to call it a day. The functionality it offered is now a default feature in the Chrome browser, making this project obsolete. Unfortunately, I won't be making any more updates.</p>
